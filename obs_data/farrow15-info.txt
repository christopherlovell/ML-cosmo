Data description

The clustering results of Farrow et al (2015). The main folder contains the 
results for the four redshift slices, many of which are flux limited (at r<19.8, from
the GAMA survey selection). The specially constructed volume limited samples are in
the volume_limited folder. The filesnames with 'mag0.1' use filters shifted to 
be at rest at z=0.1, the rest use z=0.0. The format of the filenames is

farrow15--{LOWER}.-{PARAM}--{UPPER}-{LOWERZ}-z-{UPPERZ}-wprp.dat

where PARAM is mag, mass or mag0.1, LOWER and UPPER signify the selection limits
of PARAM and LOWERZ and UPPERZ give the redshift range. 


Column Description

# col1 r_p     Projected distance (Mpc/h)
# col2 wp(r_p) Projected 2-point correlation function (Mpc/h)
# col3 error   Error on projected 2-point correlation function (Mpc/h)
